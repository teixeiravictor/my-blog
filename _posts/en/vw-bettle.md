# How disc brakes work

## A little of history
Over the years, different types of brakes have been used on many different types of vehicles. Since the invention of the wheel (originally, a domed disc wheel), the braking system has played a crucial role in slowing down or stopping moving vehicles, whether electric, self-propelled, animal-drawn, or trailer, for example. In summary, the working principle of brakes is based on the act of friction, that is, the conversion of kinetic energy into thermal energy by applying friction to the moving parts of a system. As a result, there are different variations of brake systems. At the beginning of the 20th century, when cars became widely available, the first fictional brake system models appeared, among them, we have the historical patent registration by John Stawartz (https://patents.google.com/ patent/US96042) in 1910.

But imagine this lever brake system on a car traveling at 50 mph. It would simply be impossible, or downright insane, to apply enough force to slow down and stop quickly in an emergency situation. As a result, in 1924 we have the development of the hydraulic brake by the Scottish engineer Malcolm Loughead (later the patent rights were sold to other companies, one of which was Alfred Teves Brake Systems, now Ate).

## Working principle

And the main advantage is in the use of Pascal's Principle, in which the pressure (P) applied on a point transmits to all other points of the fluid. And we have that the pressure (P) is defined by the ratio between the applied force (F) and its contact area (A). Therefore, using a hydraulic press, we have that A1 and A2 have equal pressures P1 and P2, respectively. We then have: P1=F1/A1 and P2=F2/A2. And by the pascal principle, P2=P1.

So: 

F2/A2=F1/A1

F2/F1= A2/A1

If A2 = 4A1

F2 = 4F1

In this sense, the intensities of the applied forces are directly proportional to the areas of the pistons. On the other hand, we would not have this mechanical advantage in the brake system through a simple lever, for example.

With that in mind, when you press the brake pedal, your foot moves a lever that forces a small plunger into a long cylinder filled with brake fluid. In which, it will multiply the force on the piston next to the brake disc. On the other hand, the variation of displacement in the brake pedal is greater in relation to the piston of the brake caliper. Since it is inversely proportional to the area. Causing you to have a greater displacement on the brake pedal.

## Beetle brake analysis

The image below shows the parts frame of a disc brake caliper. Note that there is a rubber that remains in direct contact with the plunger. It is the working “heart” of the tweezers. Once the pedal is pressed and, consequently, the brake is applied, it has the role of pulling the plunger to its initial position. It is interesting to note that there is a piston locking ring (6). It prevents the piston from rotating its axis and ends up reducing the life of the rubber.

Furthermore, it is worth remembering that the first Beetles have front drum brakes. I will leave an animation that shows in detail how it works.

## Practical brake repair

Brake fluid retains moisture and this causes oxidation and degradation of the internal working parts of the brake. Hence, the need for annual brake fluid change. In order to prolong the life of the brake. In my case it was no different, the beetle had not made this change for two years. And unfortunately, we are not in the habit of using it often. This caused the pistons to lock and, consequently, the front wheels were locked.

The front caliper pair is original, that is, they were manufactured by Ate. And there are no more original repairs for sale. It took a lot of searching to find them. Current assemblies do not have the ring (6) which prevents the piston from rotating.

Changing the repair is relatively simple. The worst part is removing the two plungers. Ideally, you can use an air compressor and force them out. However, if you don't have it, you can use your own brake fluid. Put a “lock” in place of the brake disc, to prevent the accidental release of one of the pistons. In parallel, activate the brake pedal, generating their movement. Once removed, the rest of the repair service turns out to be easier. After changing the repairs, bleed the Beetle completely, starting with the wheel furthest from the central system, which would be the right rear wheel. Anyway, I won't go into the full detail of the repair process. There are other materials available that already do the job of elucidating this service very well.
